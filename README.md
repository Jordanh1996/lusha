No assumptions.

It felt like there was not enough time, 3 hours that including bootstraping the project, installing dependencies, upload to git and sending the email is already eating a chunk out of it.
Felt more like coding than engineering, with more time and slightly less pressue I think what I just made would look entirely different.

And by the way, I removed the api code from the code since this is on public git. Feel free to add it to the .env file under REACT_APP_IMAGE_RETRIEVER_API_KEY environment variable key.
